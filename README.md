# AUTOMATONE: A cellular automata that creates music

I have modified the original Automatone implementation by Garrit, Pixelkind.

I have added functionality to run different CAs beyond Conwey's Game of Life. I have also implemented more user control with input-driven parameters for board size, number of boards, CA parameters of rule, totalistic/outer totalistic, neighbourhood size, initial configuration. Based on Hindustani classical music, I have also implemented custom tones, i.e. raags, which map to different moods.

You can access the interface [here](https://html-preview.github.io/?url=https://github.com/surabhisnath/automatone/blob/main/index.html)

Have fun exploring! :)
