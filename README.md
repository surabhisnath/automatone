# AUTOMATONE: A cellular automata that creates music

I have modified the original Automatone implementation by Garrit, Pixelkind. 

I have added functionality to run different CAs beyond Conwey's Game of Life. I have also implemented more user control with input-driven parameters for board size, number of boards, CA parameters of rule, totalistic/outer totalistic, neighbourhood size, initial configuration. Based on Hindustani classical music, I have also implemented custom tones, i.e. raags, which map to different moods.

Have fun exploring the interface! :)
